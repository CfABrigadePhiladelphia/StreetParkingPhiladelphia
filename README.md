Project in discovery phase. Street parking dataset for kiosk-metered zones has been requested from Streets department, likely ETA is after July 2014. Intended scope will cover creating a method to parse/manipulate dataset into usable format for API development, then UI development including a map visualization, searchable zone information such as allowed time period, cost per hour, kiosk locations and residential permit areas. Updates will follow when data is available.
